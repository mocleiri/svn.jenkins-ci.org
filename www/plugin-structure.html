<h1>Structure of Plugin</h1>
<p>
A plugin is really just a jar file that follows a certain set of
conventions, as described below:

<pre>
foo.hpi
 +- META-INF
 |   +- MANIFEST.MF
 +- WEB-INF
 |   +- classes
 |   +- lib
 +- (static resources)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    A plugin needs to have <tt>.hpi</tt> extension. The file name body
    ("foo" portion) of the file name is used as the "short name" of a
    plugin, and it uniquely distingusihes a plugin.

  <li>
    As you can see, the structure is similar to a WAR file, but
    there's no <tt>web.xml</tt>.

  <li>
    <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> needs to contain a few additional
    entries. More on this later.

  <li>
    <tt>WEB-INF/classes</tt> can have class files that constitute
    plugins, Jelly view files, and Jelly tag libraries based on tag
    files. Alternatively, some or all of them can be packaged into a
    jar and placed into <tt>WEB-INF/lib</tt>.

  <li>
    <tt>WEB-INF/lib</tt> can have *.jar files, and those are loaded
    and made available to a plugin <tt>ClassLoader</tt>, along with
    the contents of <tt>WEB-INF/classes</tt>.

  <li>
    Static resources, such as images, HTML files, CSS stylesheets,
    JavaScript fiels, etc, can be placed at the top of an
    <tt>.hpi</tt> file (just like a WAR file, again.)
</ul>

<h2>Manifest</h2>
<p>
  <tt>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</tt> can have all the normal entries, but
  it needs to contain two more entries for Hudson in its main section.

<dl>
  <dt>Plugin-Class</dt>
  <dd>
    This attribute must have the fully qualified class name of the
    class that derives from <a
    href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/Plugin.html"><tt>Plugin</tt></a>. Hudson
    instanciates this instance to activate a plugin, and everything
    starts from there. Consequently, a plugin must have one
    <tt>Plugin</tt>-derived class. This is the Hudson plugin version
    of the <tt>Main-Class</tt> attribute.

  <dt>Long-Name</dt>
  <dd>
    This optional attribute can have a human-readable one line
    description of the plugin. This is used as "the name" for users
    (whereas the short name is used as the name internally in Hudson.)
    When this attribute is not present, the short name is used as the
    long name.

  <dt>Required-Plugins</tt>
  <dd>
    This optional attribute can have a list of whitespace-separated
    plugin short names, that are required for this plugin to
    run. The classes and libraries of those plugins are made visible
    to this plugin's classloader, so that your plugin can rely on
    them.<br/>
    
    This mechanism allows a plugin to define its own extensibility
    point, and have other plugins provide implemenations.
</dl>

<h2>Static Resources</h2>
<p>
  Static resources inside an <tt>.hpi</tt> file will be made
  accessible at <tt>${HUDSON_CONTEXT_PATH}/plugin/SHORTNAME/</tt>. For
  example, if you have <tt>abc/def.png</tt> in <tt>foo.hpi</tt>, and
  if Hudson is deployed on <tt>http://localhost/hudson/</tt>, then
  the URL <tt>http://localhost/hudson/plugin/foo/abc/def.png</tt>
  would display the PNG file.

<h2>Index.jelly for Your <tt>Plugin</tt>-derived Class</h2>
<p>
  Your <tt>Plugin</tt> class (that you named in <tt>Plugin-Class</tt>
  manifest entry) should have <tt>index.jelly</tt> view file, which
  should render 1-2 paragraph worth of the detailed description of
  your plugin, perhaps with version numbers, link to the homepage,
  etc. This jelly script will be used in the plugin configuration page
  so that the user can learn more about a plugin.


<h2>Debug Plugin Layout: .hpl</h2>
<p>
  The <tt>.hpi</tt> format is primarily meant to be a distribution
  format. Just like no one debugs the web application by creating a
  war and deploying it, Hudson provides another plugin layout called
  <tt>.hpl</tt> (for "Hudson plugin link"), which is targeted for
  plugin developers to improve productivity.

<p>
  The hpl format is really just a manifest file. It has the same
  custom attributes as defined above for
  <tt>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</tt>, but it defines a few more custom
  attributes that allow a plugin developer to specify various pieces
  of a plugin in different locations in a file system.

<pre>
Plugin-Class: hudson.plugins.jwsdp_sqe.PluginImpl
Class-Path: ../../hudson/plugins/jwsdp-sqe/build/classes ../../hudson/plugins/jwsdp-sqe/views ../../hudson/plugins/jwsdp-sqe/lib/reporte.jar
Long-Name: JWSDP SQE Test Result Plugin
Resource-Path: ../../hudson/plugins/jwsdp-sqe/resources
</pre>

<p>
  For example, the above sample <tt>jwsdp-sqe.hpl</tt> states that the
  static resources of a plugin shall be loaded from the
  <tt>.../jwsdp-sqe/resources</tt>, and class files from
  <tt>.../build/classes</tt>, Jelly view files in <tt>.../views</tt>,
  and a library jar file <tt>reporter.jar</tt> shall be made available
  to the plugin classloader. Absolute path names can be also used.

<p>
  This file can be installed into Hudson just like a <tt>.hpi</tt>
  plugin, but this allows a plugin developer to avoid assembly
  steps. Also, changes to static resources and Jelly views will be
  reflected instanteneously (provided that you set the system property
  <tt>stapler.jelly.noCache</tt> to true in the container.
