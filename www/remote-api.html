<h1>Hudson Remote API</h1>

<p>
Hudson provides machine-consumable remote access API to its functionalities. Currently it comes in two flavors:

<ol>
	<li>XML
	<li>JSON with <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/jsonp-json-with-padding">JSONP support</a>
</ol>

<p>
Remote access API is offered in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a>-like style. That is, there is no single entry point for all features, and instead they are available under the <tt>".../api/"</tt> URL where <tt>"..." portion is the data that it acts on.

<p>
For example, if your Hudson installation sits at <tt>http://myhost/hudson/</tt>, <tt>http://myhost/hudson/api/</tt> will give you HTML lists all available functionalities that act on the Hudson root. For example, from here you can access all the jobs on Hudson via XML/JSON.

<p>
Or if you want to access information about a particular build at <tt>http://myhost/hudson/job/XYZ/15</tt>, then go to <tt>http://myhost/hudson/job/XYZ/15/api/</tt> and you'll see the list of functionalities for the build.

<p>
The work on this front is on-going, so if you find missing features, please file <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=ENHANCEMENT">an issue</a>.
