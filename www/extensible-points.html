<h1>Hudson Extensibility Points</h1>

<p>
Hudson defines extensibility points, which are interfaces or abstract
classes that model an aspect of a build system. Those interfaces
define contracts of what need to be implemented, and Hudson allows
plugins to contribute those implementations.

<p>
Currently the following extensibility points are available. See
javadoc for more details about how to register an implementation, as
well as what the contracts are:

<dl>
  <dt><a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/tasks/Publisher.html">Publisher</a>
  <dd>
    <tt>Publisher</tt>s run after a build is completed by
    <tt>Builder</tt>(s), and they are usually used to collect
    information out of the build. Built-in publishers include JUnit
    test result reporter, artifact archiver, fingerprint recorder, and
    so on.

  <dt><a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/tasks/Builder.html">Builder</a>
  <dd>
    <tt>Builder</tt> performs the build. It's really open-ended, but
    typically a builder drives other programs to build
    software. Built-in builders include Ant, Maven, and shell script.

  <dt><a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/scm/SCM.html">SCM</a>
  <dd>
    <tt>SCM</tt> is Hudson's interface with the source code control
    system. An <tt>SCM</tt> performs check-out operation, compute
    changes since the last build, and so on. Built-in SCMs include CVS
    and Subversion.

  <dt><a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/triggers/Trigger.html">Trigger</a>
  <dd>
    <tt>Trigger</tt> is a polling mechanism that is usually used to
    start a new build of a project. Built-in triggers include timer
    trigger and SCM polling trigger.

  <dt><a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/model/Action.html">Action</a>
  <dd>
    <tt>Action</tt> is attached to other prominent model objects (such
    as <tt>Job</tt> and <tt>Run</tt>) and expose additional data to
    users when they are seeing jobs and runs. For example, recorded
    JUnit test result becomes an action on a <tt>Build</tt> object, so
    when you are looking at a build page, it will show you a link to
    the JUnit report. Most <tt>Publisher</tt>s and <tt>Trigger</tt>s
    use this mechanism to expose data.

  <dt><a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/model/Job.html">Job</a>
  <dd>
    <tt>Job</tt> represents a "project" on Hudson &mdash; each job
    shows up as one line in the top page. This extensibility point
    allows you to define your custom "project" type. For example,
    since Maven POM contains most of the information a build system
    ever needs, so one could write a custom "Maven project"
    type. Configuration of such a project could be made significantly
    easier than the current general-purpose project configuration
    screen (and such a plugin is also likely to define its own
    extensibility points.)  Contributing to this extensibility point
    is more work, but this enables many interesting
    possibilities. Bulit-in job implementations include an external
    job monitoring project and the general-purpose software build
    project.
