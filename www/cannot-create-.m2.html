<h1>Problem creating ~/.m2</h1>

<p>
Maven needs to have the <tt>~/.m2</tt> directory for it to operate correctly. This directory will store the maven local repository, as well as configuration files like <tt>~/.m2/settings.xml</tt>. Because of this, Hudson tries to create this directory before it invokes Maven, and if it fails, it report an error like this:

<pre>
Failed to create /var/www/.m2
</pre>

<p>
In some environment, the user account that runs container may not have a permission to create such a directory. For example, maybe hudson is running as <tt>nobody</tt> with home directory set to <tt>/var/www</tt>. If so, please create this directory manually.

<p>
See <a href="http://www.nabble.com/BUG-Report-tf3401736.html">the relevant e-mail thread</a> and <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=421">a bug report</a>.
