<h1>Building a Software Project in Hudson</h1>

<p>
	Hudson can be used to perform the "official build" for a software project. This document describes how you'd typically set that up.

<h3>Setting up the project</h3>
<p>
	First you need to create a new project in Hudson, and configure it.
	We expect the project to be controlled in CVS and it has some sort of build script (ant/maven/make, etc.)
	You configure the project by telling Hudson where to check out the source code, how to build, and which produced artifacts to archive.
<p>
	Once this is done, manually schedule a build to see if your setting is correct. If a build is successful, you'll see green icons on the left pane.


<h3>Configure automatic build</h3>
<p>
	Builds can be automatically triggered by requesting the URL <tt>http://YOURHOST/hudson/job/PROJECTNAME/build</tt>. This allows you to hook Hudson builds into a variety of the set up.
	
<h4>Periodic Builds</h4>
<p>
	To perform builds periodically (for example every night in 3am), use <tt>cron</tt> to run the following program:
<pre>
wget -o /dev/null http://YOURHOST/hudson/job/PROJECTNAME/build
</pre>

<h4>Builds by e-mail (sendmail)</h4>
<p>
	If you have the root account of your system and you are using sendmail, I found it the easiest to tweak <tt>/etc/aliases</tt> and add the following entry:
<pre>
hudson-foo: "|/bin/wget -o /dev/null http://YOURHOST/hudson/job/PROJECTNAME/build"
</pre>
<p>
	and then run "newaliases" command to let sendmail know of the change. Whenever someone sends an e-mail to "hudson-foo@yoursystem", this will trigger a new build. See <a href="http://www.developer.com/open/article.php/615931">this</a> for more details about configuring sendmail.

<h4>Builds by e-mail (qmail)</h4>
<p>
	With qmail, you can write <tt>/var/qmail/alias/.qmail-hudson</tt> as follows:
<pre>
|/bin/wget -o /dev/null http://YOURHOST/hudson/job/PROJECTNAME/build"
</pre>


<h4>Builds by changes in CVS</h4>
<p>
	To perform builds whenever someone makes a change in the repository, either invoke the above program from /CVSROOT/loginfo, or hook up CVS notification e-mails as explained above.
