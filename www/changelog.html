<h3>What's new in 1.0.10</h3>
<ul>
 <li>CVS-based projects now allow builds to be tagged long after they are completed.
     (For example, if you realize 1 week later that build #95 is important, you can tag it.)
 <li>Fixed bugs in the RSS feeds (thanks to Ronald Klop)
 <li>Hudson now generates HTML files that prevents robots from accessing links
</ul>
