<h3>What's new in 1.@@</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <li>
</ul>
<h3>What's new in 1.27</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If no test result is found when a test report is configured, a build is considered a failure.
  <li>
</ul>

-->
<h3>What's new in 1.26</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The URL in the e-mail was incorrect. Fixed that.
  <li>When a new job is created by copying another, the build number wasn't reset to 1.
  <li>A bug fix is made where sometimes the e-mail notification reports incorrect results.
</ul>
<h3>What's new in 1.25</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved the performance of rendering the build page with a large test result.
  <li>Fixed a problem where a large test result consumes the PermGen space too much.
  <li>Implemented the 'fingerprint' recording. See <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/fingerprint.html">
      a separate document</a> for more details.
  <li>Fixed a problem where "tag this build" pages don't show the left task bar.
  <li>Slave can be now marked as "temporarily offline" to avoid builds to be scheduled on it
  <li>Implemented a new switch on the e-mail notification to avoid sending out
      e-mails on every unstable build. Useful for those lazy projects where test failures are the norm.
</ul>
<h3>What's new in 1.24</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tweaked the way Hudson launches a remote job, so that it can work with older versions of Unix.
      (Some Solaris systems seem to be unable to handle "~/bin/slave" while others do.)
  <li>Placed the icon to cancel builds on more places (<a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=36">issue 36</a>)
  <li>The top page and view pages can now display user-configured HTML.
      Useful for linking to relevant resources or post a notice.
  <li>Changed the URL assignment so that build #53 of project ABC is now ".../hudson/job/ABC/53".
      The next build number is no longer modifiable through the configuration screen.
      This change should make the URL more intuitive and short. Old URLs are still supported
      for the backward compatibility.
  <li>Implemented a workaround for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89419">a Firefox bug</a>
      that sometimes displays build status icons incorrectly (when you reload a build page to check the updated status.)
  <li>Fixed a bug where URLs in the notification e-mail is not escaped.
</ul>
<h3>What's new in 1.23</h3>

  <li>Slaves can now be configured so that they can be reserved
      for certain jobs.
  <li>Fixed URL assignment to test failures, so that an URL to a test result
      of the last successful build can point to the same test across builds.
  <li>Test results in a class view is now sortable (just like all the other tables.) 
</ul>
