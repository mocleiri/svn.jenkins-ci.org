<h1>Hudson Architecture</h1>

<p>
  Hudson is primarily a set of Java classes that model the concepts of
  a build system in a straight-forward fashion (and if you are using
  Hudson, you've seen most of those already. There are classes like

  <a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/model/Project.html"><tt>Project</tt></a>,
  <a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/model/Build.html"><tt>Build</tt></a>, that
  represents what the name says. The root of this object model is
  <a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/model/Hudson.html"><tt>Hudson</tt></a>, and
  all the other model objects are reachable from here.

<p>
  Then there are interfaces and classes that model code that performs
  a part of a build, such as

  <a href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/scm/SCM.html"><tt>SCM</tt></a> for accessing
  source code control system, <a
  href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/tasks/Ant.html"><tt>Ant</tt></a> for performing
  an Ant-based build, <a
  href="/nonav/javadoc/?hudson/tasks/Mailer.html"><tt>Mailer</tt></a> for
  sending out e-mail notifications.

<h3>Stapler</h3>
<p>
  Those Hudson classes are bound to URLs by using <a
  href="https://stapler.dev.java.net/">Stapler</a>. The singleton
  <tt>Hudson</tt> instance is bound to the "/" URL, and the rest of
  the objects are bound accordingly.
<p>
  For example, there's the <tt>Hudson.getJob(String)</tt> method. So
  the URL <tt>/job/foo/</tt> will be bound to the object returned by
  <tt>Hudson.getJob("foo")</tt> (which would be a <tt>Project</tt>
  object that corresponds to the "foo" project.  See stapler
  documentation for more about how it binds Java object model to a URL
  hierarchy.

<p>
  Each Hudson model objects have multiple "views" that are used to
  render HTML pages about the object. Hudson uses <a
  href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/">Jelly</a> as the
  view technology (which is somewhat similar to JSP+<a
  href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/">JSTL</a>.) Views are
  really like methods, and each of them work against a particular
  class. So <a
  href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/source/browse/hudson/hudson/views/hudson/model/">the
  views are organized according to classes</a> that they belong to,
  just like methods are organized according to classes that they
  belong to. Again, see <a href="https://stapler.dev.java.net/">the
  stapler project</a> for more about how this works.

<h4>Taglibs</h4>
<p>
  Hudson defines <a
  href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/source/browse/hudson/hudson/views/lib/">a
  few Jelly tag libraries</a> to encourage views to have the common
  theme. For example, <a
  href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/source/browse/hudson/hudson/views/lib/layout/">one
  of them</a> defines tags that form the basic page layout of Hudson,
  <a
  href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/source/browse/hudson/hudson/views/lib/form/">another
  one</a> defines tags that are used in the configuration pages, and
  so on.

<h3>Persistence</h3>
<p>
  Hudson uses the file system to store its data. Directories are
  created inside <tt>$HUDSON_HOME</tt> in a way that models the object
  model structure. Some data, like console output, are stored just as
  plain text file. Some are stored in Java property file format. But
  the majority of the structured data, such as how a project is
  configured, or various records of the build, are persisted by using
  <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a>.

<p>
  This allows object state to be persisted relatively easily
  (including those from plugins), but one must pay attention to what's
  serialized in XML, and take measures to preserve backward
  compatibility. For example, in various parts of Hudson you see the
  <tt>transient</tt> keyword (which instructs XStream not to bind the
  field to XML), fields left strictly for backward compatibility, or
  re-construction of in-memory data structure after data is loaded.

<h4>More persistence topics</h4>

  <li><a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/source/browse/hudson/hudson/main/core/src/main/java/hudson/XmlFile.java?view=markup">Evolving data structure</a>
</ul>

<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>
  Hudson's object model is extensible (for example, one can define
  additional SCM implementations, provided that they implement certain
  interfaces), and it supports the notion of
  "plugins," which can plug into those extensibility points and extend
  the capabilities of Hudson.

<p>
  Hudson loads each plugin into a separate class loader to avoid
  conflicts. Plugins can then participate to the system activities
  just like other Hudson built-in classes do. They can participate in
  XStream-based persistence, they can provide "views" by Jelly, they
  can provide static resources like images, and from users, everything
  works seamlessly --- there's no distinction between functionalities
  that are built-in vs those from plugins.
