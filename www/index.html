<h1>What Is Hudson?</h1>
<p>
	Hudson monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron. Among those things, current Hudson focuses on the following two jobs:
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Building software projects continuously, just like <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a> or <a href="http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/">DamageControl</a>.</b>
			In a nutshell, Hudson provides an easy-to-use build system, making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continoues build increases the productivity.
		<li>
			<b>Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs</b>, such as cron jobs and procmail jobs. For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them and notice when it broke. Hudson keeps those outputs and lets you quickly notice when something went wrong.
	</ol>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>
	Hudson offers the following features:
	<dl>
		<dt>Easy installation<dt>
		<dd>
			If you have a running servlet container (such as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>), installation is as easy as copying a war file into it.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Change set support</dt>
		<dd>
			Hudson can generate a list of changes made into the build from CVS.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Permanent links to "latest build"/"latest successful build"</dt>
		<dd>
			Hudson gives you a fixed URL for those, so that they can be easily linked from elsewhere.
		</dd>
	</dl>


<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To run Hudson, you need to have:
<ul>
	<li>J2SE 1.4 or later
	<li>Serlvet container that supports Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 or later, such as Tomcat 5.
</ul>
<p>
	Deploy <tt>hudson.war</tt> as you would any WAR file. For Tomcat, that means copying the file into <tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</tt>, then access <tt>http://YOURHOST/hudson/</tt>

<h1>Upgrade</h1>
<p>
	To upgrade from earlier versions of Hudson, simply redeploy the WAR file. In case of Tomcat, this means just overwriting your <tt>hudson.war</tt> and restarting Tomcat (or see Tomcat documentation for other ways to redeploy.)
