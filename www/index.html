<p>
	Hudson monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron. Among those things, current Hudson focuses on the following two jobs:
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Building software projects continuously, just like <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a> or <a href="http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/">DamageControl</a>.</b>
			In a nutshell, Hudson provides an easy-to-use build system, making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continoues build increases the productivity.
		<li>
			<b>Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs</b>, such as cron jobs and procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine. For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them dilligently and notice when it broke. Hudson keeps those outputs and makes it easy for you to notice when something is wrong.
	</ol>

	Hudson offers the following features:
	<dl>
		<dt>Easy installation<dt>
		<dd>
			If you have a running servlet container (such as <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>), installation is as easy as copying a war file into it.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Change set support</dt>
		<dd>
			Hudson can generate a list of changes made into the build from CVS/Subversion.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Permanent links to "latest build"/"latest successful build"</dt>
		<dd>
			Hudson gives you a fixed URL for those, so that they can be easily linked from elsewhere.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>RSS/E-mail Integration</dt>
		<dd>
			Monitor build results by RSS or e-mail to get real-time notifications on failures.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>After-the-fact tagging</dt>
		<dd>
			Builds can be tagged long after builds are completed
		</dd>
	</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>No more "full rebuild" before a commit
	<dd>
		With Hudson, I stopped doing a rebuild before I commit. Nowadays I just commit, and let Hudson check if a build fails or not for me. Meanwhile, I move on to work on other things. If a build fails, Hudson can tell me so within a few minutes, so breaking a build for that short period of time is not really a problem. Thanks to this, I can spend my time more productively.
	
	<dt>No more running tests locally
	<dd>
		With Hudson, I stopped running unit tests locally. I just commit, and let Hudson run it for me. Meanwhile, I move on to work on other things. In this way, I save time and I can be more productive.
	
	<dt>No more sending bug fixes
	<dd>
		When someone needs an urgent bug fix for my project, I used to fix a bug, do a build, and send him the updated build via e-mail. With Hudson, I no longer have to do this. I just fix a bug and commit. He knows where my Hudson is, so he can pull the new bits by himself. This saves my time, and it makes me more productive.
	
	<dt>No more workspace tagging
	<dd>
		When someone needs a CVS tag for my project (for example, JAX-WS occasionally want a JAXB snapshot), he used to send me an e-mail, I then run <tt>cvs rtag</tt> manually, and reply him back when it's done. With Hudson, I no longer has to do any of this. Every version I deliver to him has a Hudson build Id baked in. So when he wants a tag for a particular version, he can just use Hudson to tag it. instead of sending me an e-mail. This saves my time, and it makes me more productive.
</dl>
<p>
	I think by now you should have seen the pattern. It's all about making developers more productive.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To run Hudson, you need to have:
<ul>
	<li>J2SE 1.4 or later
	<li>Serlvet container that supports Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 or later, such as Tomcat 5.
</ul>
<p>
	Deploy <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=2761"><tt>hudson.war</tt></a> as you would any WAR file. For Tomcat, that means copying the file into <tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</tt>, then access <tt>http://YOURHOST/hudson/</tt>
<p>
	Once the war file is exploded, run <tt>chmod 755 hudson</tt> in the exploded <tt>hudson/WEB-INF</tt> directory so that you can execute this shell script.

<h3>Upgrade</h3>
<p>
	To upgrade from earlier versions of Hudson, simply redeploy the WAR file. In case of Tomcat, this means just overwriting your <tt>hudson.war</tt> and restarting Tomcat (or see Tomcat documentation for other ways to redeploy.)
