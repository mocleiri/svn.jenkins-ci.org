    Specifies the execution schedule in a cron notation when a differential backup should be done. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Wikipedia</a> for more information.
    <br/><br/>
    A differential backup stores only complete files whose modification is done after the last full backup. To restore a configuration state on a differential backup you need to restore the full backup first and then the differential backup you need. 
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Note:</b> For a differential backup at least one full backup is needed. If no full backup is available it will be done instead of the first differential backup.
