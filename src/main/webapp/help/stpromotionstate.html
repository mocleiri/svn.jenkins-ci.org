    When checked, the label name is considered the name of a promotion state.

    <i>A promotion state is a name that points to a label.  This allows a common name (DEV, TEST)
      that points to labels like "release-5.2.6" and "release-5.2.7" ensuring that the release team
      has fine control over which labels get build without reconfiguring their environment every
      release.
