<p>
This plugin exports Jenkins (runtime) job parameters into a <tt>.properties</tt> file. 
So other build steps (e.g. ant scripts) can read those parameters and work with them. 
For example: send some information via email to the user who triggered a job.
<br/>
The property file is named <tt>hudsonBuild.properties</tt> and will be created in the project workspace.
See <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+Exporter+Plugin">Job Exporter Plugin Wiki</a> for more informations.
