    The path that contains "wsclient.jar" and "wsobjects.jar", if not specified, it will be auto-detected by locating "fortifyclient" in the search PATH, and then deduce the lib path. Both "fortifyclient", "wsclient.jar" and "wsobjects.jar" are included in the Fortify 360 installation
  </p>
  <p>
    This path should be a local path of Hudson MASTER node. 
  </p>
  <p>
  	If you don't have a full Fortify 360 installation on the Hudson MASTER node, you can just copy the following JARs and setup this path manually
  	<ul>
  		<li>wsclient.jar</li>
  		<li>wsobjects.jar</li>
  		<li>fortify-common.jar (only for v3.0.0 or above)</li>
  		<li>common.jar (only for v2.6 or above)</li>
  		<li>common13.jar (only for v2.6 or above)</li>
  	</ul>
