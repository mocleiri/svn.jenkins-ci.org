  Pick the QuickTest Professional Add-in version to install.<br/>
  This is very important to pick the right version since the installation process
  is not the same from one version to another.<br/>
  <i>If the QuickTest Professional Add-in version you run is not there, well,
  kindly <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/">contribute a patch</a> to add
  support for it!</i>
