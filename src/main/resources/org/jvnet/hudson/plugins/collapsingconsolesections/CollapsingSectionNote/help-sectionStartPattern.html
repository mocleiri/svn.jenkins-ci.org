<div>
    A Java regular expression pattern that identifies the start
    of a section. When viewing a build console, a heading will be placed
    above a line that matches this regex. The visibility of all console output
    between this line and the next line that matches the ending pattern can be
    toggled by clicking the Show/Hide action in the heading. Sections can be nested.
