description.pattern=<a href="{0}">Fileset ''includes''</a> \
                 setting that specifies the files to scan for warnings. If no pattern is specified then only the build log will \
                 be scanned.
description.includePattern=<a href="{0}">Fileset ''includes''</a> \
                 setting that specifies the warnings to include in the report (based on their filename).
description.excludePattern=<a href="{0}">Fileset ''excludes''</a> \
                 setting that specifies the warnings to exclude from the report (based on their filename).
description.parsers=The parsers to use when scanning the build log or the specified files. \
                 It is recommended to select at least one parser, otherwise all available parsers are used \
                 (requires more memory, increases the runtime and may produce duplicate warnings). \
                 If none of the parsers fits your project then you can create your own parser in the \
                 <a href="../../configure">system configuration</a> section.
description.canScanConsole=If you want to scan the console output for warnings then enable this option.
