<div>
    Specify the host name(s) that this tunnel represents. Multiple host names can be specified with
    whitespace as a separator. Whenever tests running inside Sauce OnDemand accesses the "remote port" on these
    host name, those connections are forwarded to the "local port" of the "local host".

    <p>
    Sauce OnDemand has a natural restriction where the remote host name needs to be unique across
    all the tunnels under your user account. However, this doesn't work well if you are trying to
    run the same test in different environments in parallel, or perform multiple builds of the same
    job concurrently. To resolve this problem, you can specify <tt>AUTO</tt> here to let Hudson
    generate a unique host name &mdash; this host name will be then exposed to your build
    as the environment variable <tt>SAUCE_ONDEMAND_HOST</tt>. If you do that, your test needs
    to drive Selenium accordingly to use this as the host name.
