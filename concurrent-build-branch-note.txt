TODO:
- remove reference to AbstarctProject.getWorkspace() and getModuleRoot() by AbstractBuild.getWorkspace()

- fix build history view partial update JavaScript to handle multiple concurrent builds

- serialize the changelog calculation. How do we handle backward compatibility?

- figure out what to do with AbstractProject.getWorkspaceResource(). I just removed it from
  AbstractProject.getResourceList() but this will break the lock mechanism with SCM polling, tagging, and
  other related activities that require a workspace.

- replace various "1.XXX" reference to the right revision when we merge this back to trunk.
