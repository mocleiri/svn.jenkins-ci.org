TODO:
- serialize the changelog calculation. How do we handle backward compatibility?

- serialize post build steps, like computing test results, since they depend on the previous result.
  we need some way to mark the build steps that need this service, in a way that preserves compatibility.

- figure out what to do with AbstractProject.getWorkspaceResource(). I just removed it from
  AbstractProject.getResourceList() but this will break the lock mechanism with SCM polling, tagging, and
  other related activities that require a workspace.

- remove reference to AbstarctProject.getWorkspace() and getModuleRoot() by AbstractBuild.getWorkspace()

- replace various "1.XXX" reference to the right revision when we merge this back to trunk.
