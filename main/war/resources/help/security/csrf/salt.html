  The salt value is taken as an input to the crumb generation algorithm. It acts
  as further randomization to complicate dictionary style attacks against the
  algorithm. In the context of CSRF exploits against Hudson servers, each Hudson
  server should use a different salt value. If multiple Hudson servers all use
  a crumb generation algorithm that gets broken, the salt prevents an attacker
  from running CSRF exploits against all these servers.
