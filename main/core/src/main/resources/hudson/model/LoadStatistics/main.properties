title=Load statistics: {0}
blurb=\
  Load statistics keep track of three key metrics of resource utilization: \
  <dl> \
    <dt>Total number of executors</dt> \
    <dd>\
      For a computer, this is the number of executors that the computer has. \
      For a label, this is the sum of all executors across all computers in this label. \
      For the entire Hudson, this is the sum of all executors across all computers in this Hudson installation. \
      Other than configuration changes, this value can also change when slaves go offline. \
    </dd> \
    <dt>Number of busy executors</dt> \
    <dd>\
      This line tracks the number of executors (among the executors counted above) \
      that are carrying out builds. The ratio of this to the total number of executors \
      gives you the resource utilization. If all your executors are busy for \
      a prolonged period of time, consider adding more computers to your Hudson cluster.\
    </dd>\
    <dt>Queue length</dt>\
    <dd>\
      This is the number of jobs that are in the build queue, waiting for an \
      available executor (of this computer, of this label, or in this Hudson, respectively.) \
      This doesn't include jobs that are in the quiet period, nor does it include \
      jobs that are in the queue because earlier builds are still in progress. \
      If this line ever goes above 0, that means your Hudson will run more builds by \
      adding more computers.\
    </dd>\
  </dl>\
  The graph is exponential moving average. 3 timespans are updated every 10 seconds, \
  1 minute, and 1 hour respectively.
