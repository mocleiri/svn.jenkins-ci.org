  For projects that use Ant as the build system. This causes Hudson to
  invoke Ant with the given targets and options. Non-0 exit code from
  Ant makes Hudson to mark the build as a failure.

  <p>
  If your build script is located in somewhere other than the module top
  <tt>build.xml</tt>, then you can use <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html#options">
  Ant's <tt>-f</tt> option</a> to specify where it is.
