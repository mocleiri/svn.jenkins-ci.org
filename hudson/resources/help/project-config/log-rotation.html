  This controls the disk consumption of Hudson by managing how long you'd like to keep
  records of the builds (such as console output, build artifacts, and so on.)
  Hudson offers two criteria:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Driven by age. You can have Hudson delete records if it reaches certain age
      (for example, 7 days old.)
    <li>
      Driven by number. You can have Hudson make sure that it only maintains up to
      N records of the builds. If a new build is started, the oldest record will
      be simply removed.
  </ol>

  Hudson also allows you to mark individual build as 'Keep this log forever', to
  exclude certain important builds from being discarded automatically.
