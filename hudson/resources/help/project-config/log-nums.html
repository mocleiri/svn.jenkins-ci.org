<div>
  If a value is entered, this limits the number of build records
  (such as console log, artifacts, etc) kept for this job. As new
  builds are recorded, old ones will be discarded automatically.
  (Unless they are marked as 'keep this log forever')<br>

  This is useful to control the disk consumption.
