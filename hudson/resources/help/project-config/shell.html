<div>
  Runs shell script (default to <tt>sh</tt> but configurable) for building the project.
  The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory.

  shell will be invoked with "-ex" option. So all the commands are printed before executed,
  and the build is considered a failure if any of the commands exit with a non-zero exit code.
