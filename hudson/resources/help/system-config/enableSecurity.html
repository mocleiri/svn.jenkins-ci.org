  If enabled, you have to log with an username and a password that has "admin" role
  in before changing the configuration or running a new build (look for the "login" link
  at the top right portion of the page.)
  Configuration of user accounts is specific to the web container you are using.
  (For example, in Tomcat, by default, it looks for <tt>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</tt>)

  <p>
  If you are using Hudson in an intranet (or other "trusted" environment), it's usually
  desirable to leave this checkbox off, so that each project developer can configure its own
  project without bothering you.

  <p>
  If you are exposing Hudson to the internet, you must turn this on. Hudson launches
  processes, so unsecure Hudson is a sure way of being hacked.
