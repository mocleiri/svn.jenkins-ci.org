/**
 * Represents a communication channel to the remote peer.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} is a mechanism for two JVMs to communicate over
 * bi-directional {@link InputStream}/{@link OutputStream} pair.
 * {@link Channel} represents an endpoint of the stream, and thus
 * two {@link Channel}s are always used in a pair.
 *
 * <p>
 * Communication is established as soon as two {@link Channel} instances
 * are created at the end fo the stream pair
 * until the stream is terminated via {@link #close()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The basic unit of remoting is an executable {@link Callable} object.
 * An application can create a {@link Callable} object, and execute it remotely
 * by using the {@link #call(Callable)} method or {@link #callAsync(Callable)} method.
 *
 * <p>
 * In this sense, {@link Channel} is a mechanism to delegate/offload computation
 * to other JVMs and somewhat like an agent system. This is bit different from
 * remoting technologies like CORBA or web services, where the server exposes a
 * certain functionality that clients invoke. 
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link Callable} object, as well as the return value / exceptions,
 * are transported by using Java serialization. All the necessary class files
 * are also shipped over {@link Channel} on-demand, so there's no need to
 * pre-deploy such classes on both JVMs. 
 *
 *
 * <h2>Implementor's Note</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link Channel} builds its features in a layered model. Its higher-layer
 * features are built on top of its lower-layer features, and they
 * are called layer-0, layer-1, etc.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  <b>Layer 0</b>:
 *  See {@link Command} for more details. This is for higher-level features,
 *  and not likely useful for applications directly.
 * <li>
 *  <b>Layer 1</b>:
 *  See {@link Request} for more details. This is for higher-level features,
 *  and not likely useful for applications directly.
 * </ul>

     *
     * <p>
     * This is a performance improvement method that can be safely
     * ignored if your goal is to make things working.
     *
     * <p>
     * Normally, classes are transferred over the network one at a time,
     * on-demand. This design is mainly driven by how Java classloading works
     * &mdash; we can't predict what classes will be necessarily upfront very easily.
     *
     * <p>
     * Classes are loaded only once, so for long-running {@link Channel},
     * this is normally an acceptable overhead. But sometimes, for example
     * when a channel is short-lived, or when you know that you'll need
     * a majority of classes in certain jar files, then it is more efficient
     * to send a whole jar file over the network upfront and thereby
     * avoiding individual class transfer over the network.
     *
     * <p>
     * That is what this method does. It ensures that a series of jar files
     * are copied to the remote side (AKA "preloading.")
     * Classloading will consult the preloaded jars before performing
     * network transfer of class files.
     *
     * @param classLoaderRef
     *      This parameter is used to identify the remote classloader
     *      that will prefetch the specified jar files. That is, prefetching
     *      will ensure that prefetched jars will kick in
     *      when this {@link Callable} object is actually executed remote side.
     *
     *      <p>
     *      {@link RemoteClassLoader}s are created wisely, one per local {@link ClassLoader},
     *      so this parameter doesn't have to be exactly the same {@link Callable}
     *      to be executed later &mdash; it just has to be of the same class.
     * @param classesInJar
     *      {@link Class} objects that identify jar files to be preloaded.
     *      Jar files that contain the specified classes will be preloaded into the remote peer.
     *      You just need to specify one class per one jar.
     * @return
     *      true if the preloading actually happened. false if all the jars
     *      are already preloaded. This method is implemented in such a way that
     *      unnecessary jar file transfer will be avoided, and the return value
     *      will tell you if this optimization kicked in. Under normal circumstances
     *      your program shouldn't depend on this return value. It's just a hint.
