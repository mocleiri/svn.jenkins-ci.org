/**
 * Represents a communication channel to the remote peer.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} is a mechanism for two JVMs to communicate over
 * bi-directional {@link InputStream}/{@link OutputStream} pair.
 * {@link Channel} represents an endpoint of the stream, and thus
 * two {@link Channel}s are always used in a pair.
 *
 * <p>
 * Communication is established as soon as two {@link Channel} instances
 * are created at the end fo the stream pair
 * until the stream is terminated via {@link #close()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The basic unit of remoting is an executable {@link Callable} object.
 * An application can create a {@link Callable} object, and execute it remotely
 * by using the {@link #call(Callable)} method or {@link #callAsync(Callable)} method.
 *
 * <p>
 * In this sense, {@link Channel} is a mechanism to delegate/offload computation
 * to other JVMs and somewhat like an agent system. This is bit different from
 * remoting technologies like CORBA or web services, where the server exposes a
 * certain functionality that clients invoke. 
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link Callable} object, as well as the return value / exceptions,
 * are transported by using Java serialization. All the necessary class files
 * are also shipped over {@link Channel} on-demand, so there's no need to
 * pre-deploy such classes on both JVMs. 
 *
 *
 * <h2>Implementor's Note</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link Channel} builds its features in a layered model. Its higher-layer
 * features are built on top of its lower-layer features, and they
 * are called layer-0, layer-1, etc.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  <b>Layer 0</b>:
 *  See {@link Command} for more details. This is for higher-level features,
 *  and not likely useful for applications directly.
 * <li>
 *  <b>Layer 1</b>:
 *  See {@link Request} for more details. This is for higher-level features,
 *  and not likely useful for applications directly.
 * </ul>
