<div>
  Trigger builds of the other projects once a build is successfully completed.
  Multiple projects can be specified by using comma, like "abc, def".

  <p>
  Other than the obvious use case where you'd like to build other projects that have a dependency
  to the current project, this can be also useful to split a long build process to multiple
  stages (such as the build portion and the test portion.)
