  For projects that use Maven as the build system. This causes Hudson to
  invoke Maven with the given goals and options. Non-0 exit code from
  Maven makes Hudson to mark the build as a failure.
  Some maven versions have a bug where it doesn't return the exit code correctly.

  <p>
  Hudson passes <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/hudson/hudson/main/war/resources/env-vars.html">
  various environment variables</a> to Maven, which you can acecss from Maven as "${env.VARIABLENAME}".

  <p>
  The same variables can be used in the command-line argument (as if you are invoking this from shell.)
  For example, you can specify <tt>-DresultsFile=${WORKSPACE}/${BUILD_TAG}.results.txt</tt>
