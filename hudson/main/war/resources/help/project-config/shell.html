<div>
  Runs a shell script (defaults to <tt>sh</tt>, but this configurable) for building the project.
  The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory.

  The shell will be invoked with the "-ex" option. So all of the commands are printed before being executed,
  and the build is considered a failure if any of the commands exits with a non-zero exit code.
