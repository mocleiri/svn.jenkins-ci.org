  By default, Hudson builds all the possible combinations of axes exhaustively. But sometimes this is too many.
  In such a situation, you can make the matrix sparse by filtering out combinations that you don't want through
  a Goorvy expression that returns true or false.

  <p>
  When you specify a Groovy expression here, only the combinations that result in <b>true</b>
  will be built. In evaluating the expression, axes are exposed as variables (with their values set
  to the current combination evaluated.)

  <p>    
  For example, let's say you are building on different operating systems for
  different compilers. Assume that your slave labels are <b>label=[linux,solaris]</b> and you have
  created an axis as <b>compiler=[gcc,cc].</b>
    
  Any of the following expressions will filter out <b>cc</b> builds on <b>linux</b>. Depending on
  how you think about this constraint, you'll probably find some more intuitive than others.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Read "if both linux and cc, it's invalid"</td>
            <td>
                <pre>!(label=="linux" && compiler=="cc")</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Read "for a combination to be valid, it has to be either on solaris or on gcc."</td>
            <td>
                <pre>label=="solaris" || compiler=="gcc"</pre>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Read "if on Solaris, just do cc"</td>
            <td>
                <pre>(label=="solaris").implies(compiler=="cc")</pre>
            </td>
