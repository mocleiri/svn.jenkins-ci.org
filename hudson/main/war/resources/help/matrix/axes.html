  If your configuration matrix needs additional axes, you can specify them here.
  <p>
  For example, let's say you are trying to run a test for your database application,
  and you need to test it with three databases, mysql and postgresql, and oracle. Your
  build script is designed so that you can test with a particular database by doing
  <tt>ant -Ddatabase=mysql</tt>.
  <p>
  This is the concept of axis. You can have a variable called "database",
  which takes three values. When you configure it, Hudson will run 3 builds, each with
  different values assigned to the "database" variable to exhaustively cover
  the configuration matrix.
