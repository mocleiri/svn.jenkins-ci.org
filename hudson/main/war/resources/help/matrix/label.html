<div>
  Specify nodes where builds are performed.

  <ul>
    <li>
      If none is selected, Hudson will choose
      available node to perform a build (this is the same behavior to the free-style
      project when "tie this project to node" is not selected.) This is useful
      when the project doesn't have a dependency to any particular node, as
      it allows Hudson to utilize nodes in optimal fashion.
    <li>
      If one is selected, Hudson will always run the build on the specified node
      (if you select one from "specific nodes")
      or one of the nodes that belong to the label (if you select one from "label".)
      This is useful when the build is required to run on a specific computer,
      or a subset of computers. For example, maybe your build requiers MacOS X.
    <li>
      If multiple values are selected, the build matrix will be expanded to include
      them all, and builds will be performed on all the selected nodes/labels.
      This is useful for example when you'd like to run tests on Windows, Linux,
      and Solaris.
  </ul>
