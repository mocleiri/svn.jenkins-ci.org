  Specify the JDK(s) with which builds are performed. If none is selected,
  the default JDK is used (no explicit <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt>, and <tt>java</tt> command
  is assumed to be in <tt>PATH</tt>.) If multiple JDKs are selected,
  the configuration matrix will includes all the specified JDKs.

  Selecting multiple values is typically useful when this job is running tests,
  and you need to run tests on multiple different versions of JDKs.
