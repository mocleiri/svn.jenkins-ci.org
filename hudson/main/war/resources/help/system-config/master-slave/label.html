  Labels (AKA tags) are used for grouping multiple slaves into one logical group.

  <p>
  For example, if you have multiple Windows slaves and you have jobs that require
  Windows, then you can configure all your Windows slaves to have a label 'windows',
  then tie the job to the 'windows' label. This allows your job to run on any
  of your Windows slaves but not on anywhere else.
