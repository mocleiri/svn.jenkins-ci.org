  Command to be used to execute a program on this slave, such as
  'ssh slave1' or 'rsh slave2'. Hudson appends the actual command it wants to run
  after this and then execute it locally, and then expects the command you supplied
  to do the remote job submission.

  <p>
  Normally, you'd want to use SSH and RSH for this, but
  it can be any custom program as well.

  <p>
  Setting this to "ssh -v <i>hostname</i>" may be useful for debugging connectivity
  issue.
