  If this option is enabled, all <a href="lastSuccessfulBuild/fingerprint">
  the builds that are referenced</a> from builds of this project (via fingerprint)
  will be protected from log rotation.

  <p>
  When your job depends on other jobs on Hudson and you occasionally need
  to tag your workspace, it's often convenient/necessary to also tag your
  dependencies on Hudson. The problem is that the log rotation could
  interface with this, since the build your project is using might be already
  log rotated (if there has been a lot of builds in your dependency), and
  if that happens you won't be able to reliably tag you dependencies.

  <p>
  This feature fixes that problem by "locking" those builds that you depend on,
  thereby guaranteeing that you can always tag your complete dependencies.
