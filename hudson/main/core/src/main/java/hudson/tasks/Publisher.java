 * Starting 1.178, publishers are exposed to all kinds of different

 * the native maven2 job type.) This is convenient default for
 * {@link Publisher}s in particular initially, but we encourage advanced
 * plugins to consider writing {@link MavenReporter}, as it offers the
 * potential of reducing the amount of configuration needed to run the plugin.
 *
 * For those plugins that don't want {@link Publisher} to show up in
 * different job type, use {@link BuildStepDescriptor} for the base type
 * of your descriptor to control which job type it supports.
