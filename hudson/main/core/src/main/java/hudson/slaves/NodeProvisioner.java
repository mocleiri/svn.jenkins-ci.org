            Here we determine how many additional slaves we need to keep up with the load (if at all),
            which involves a simple math.

            Broadly speaking, first we check that all the executors are fully utilized before attempting
            to start any new slave (this also helps to ignore the temporary gap between different numbers,
            as changes in them are not necessarily synchronized --- for example, there's a time lag between
            when a slave launches (thus bringing the planned capacity down) and the time when its executors
            pick up builds (thus bringing the queue length down.)

            Once we confirm that, we compare the # of buildable items against the additional slaves
            that are being brought online. If we have more jobs than our executors can handle, we'll launch a new slave.

            So this computation involves three stats:

              1. # of idle executors
              2. # of jobs that are starving for executors
              3. # of additional slaves being provisioned (planned capacities.)

            To ignore a temporary surge/drop, we make conservative estimates on each one of them. That is,
            we take the current snapshot value, and we take the current exponential moving average (EMA) value,
            and use the max/min.

            This is another measure to be robust against temporary surge/drop in those indicators, and helps
            us avoid over-reacting to stats.

            If we only use the snapshot value or EMA value, tests confirmed that the gap creates phantom
            excessive loads and Hudson ends up firing excessive capacities. In a static system, over the time
            EMA and the snapshot value becomes the same, so this makes sure that in a long run this conservative
            estimate won't create a starvation.

                    // provisioning a new node should be conservative --- for example if exceeWorkload is 1.4,
                    // we don't want to allocate two nodes but just one.
                    // OTOH, because of the exponential decay, even when we need one slave, excess workload is always
                    // something like 0.95, in which case we want to allocate one node.
