  This type of job allows you to record the execution of a process run outside Hudson
  (perhaps even on a remote machine.) This is designed so that you can use Hudson
  as a dashboard of your existing automation system. See
  <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/cron.html">the documentation for more details.</a>
