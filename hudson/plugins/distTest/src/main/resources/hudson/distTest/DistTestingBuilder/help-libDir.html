    <p>Specify a directory with jar files or a single jar file on the master's file system
        which is needed for (compilation and) running tests. For example if you have libraries in the directory
        C:\shared\libraries then put "C:\shared\libraries" or in the jar file
        C:\shared\libraries\someJar.jar then type "C:\shared\libraries\someJar.jar".
