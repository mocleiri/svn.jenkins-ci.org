        The goal of this plugin is to enable a distributed testing of some compiled classes
        on multiple nodes. Tests are send one by one to the executors on nodes and run. Test results
        are saved in the <b>"results" directory</b> in the project workspace as "Test-testClassName.xml" files.
        f.e. "Test-helloword.HelloTest.xml" for the test class "helloworld.HelloTest". A zip archive
        "test-results.zip" with all test results is saved in the artifacts directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            This plugin suppose that all slaves in the specified label have a shared workspace directory.
            (like NFS)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Only classes in the "Tests classes directory" directory with a file name containing
            a "test" substring (case insensitive) are automatically found by this plugin and run.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you enable "Publish JUnit test result report" in the "Post-build Actions" section
        and type "results/*.xml" you will see test results in the Hudson's web UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only nodes in a label which were specified for this project ("Tie this project to a node")
        will be used for distributed testing. This label must contain at least 2 executors and cannot
        contain master.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible let this plugin to compile tests class sources which <b>were checkout from a
        repository</b> if "Compile tests" checkbox was checked. Remember to provide all necessary libraries
        needed for compilation.
    </p>
    <p><b>At least two executors are needed for this build step to run. Otherwise build will be
            stopped.</b> It's possible to check a "Wait for executors which are busy to be freed"
            checkbox to wait for other executors which are busy to be freed.
