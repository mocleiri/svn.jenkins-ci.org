        The goal of this plugin is to enable a distributed testing of compiled classes
        on multiple nodes. Tests are send one by one to nodes in the label specified for the project and run. Test results
        are saved in the <b>"results"</b> directory in the project workspace.
        f.e. "TEST-helloword.HelloTest.xml" for the test class "helloworld.HelloTest".
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            This plugin suppose that all slaves in the specified label have a shared workspace directory.
            (like NFS)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Only classes in the "Tests classes directory" directory with a file name containing
            a "test" substring (case insensitive) are automatically found by this plugin and run.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you enable "Publish JUnit test result report" in the "Post-build Actions" section
        and type "results/*.xml" you will see test results in the Hudson's web UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only nodes in a label which were specified for this project ("Tie this project to a node")
        will be used for distributed testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible let this plugin to compile tests class sources which were checkout from a
        repository if "Compile tests" checkbox was checked. Remember to provide all necessary libraries
        needed for compilation.
    </p>
    <p>It's possible to check a "Wait for nodes which are busy"
            checkbox to wait for other nodes which are busy to be freed.
