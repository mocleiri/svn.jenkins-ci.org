        This specifies a relative path against the project workspace where compiled tests resides. For
        example if the workspace directory is in C:\hudson_workspace\workspace\job_name and tests are in
        the directory C:\hudson_workspace\workspace\job_name\build\test\classes then type
        "build/test/classes". In case you check "Compile tests" checkbox this relative path will be used for
        storing compiled tests classes which were before check-out from a repository.
