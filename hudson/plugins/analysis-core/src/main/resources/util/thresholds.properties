description.threshold=If the total number of warnings exceeds this threshold then a build is \
                   considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
                   should not depend on the total number of warnings.
description.newThreshold=If the number of new warnings exceeds this threshold then a build is \
                   considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
                   should not depend on the number of new warnings.
description.failureThreshold=If the total number of warnings exceeds this threshold then a build is \
                   considered as failed. Leave this field empty if the failed state of the build \
                   should not depend on the total number of warnings.
description.newFailureThreshold=If the number of new warnings exceeds this threshold then a build is \
                   considered as failed. Leave this field empty if the failed state of the build \
                   should not depend on the number of new warnings.
description.status=Configure the build status and health. A build is considered as unstable or failure \
                   if the new or total number of warnings exceeds the specified thresholds. \
                   The build health is also determined by thresholds. If the actual number of warnings is between \
                   the provided thresholds, then the build health is interpolated.
description.limit=Determines which warning priorities should be considered when evaluating the build status and health.
description.useDeltaValues=If set then the number of new warnings is calculated by subtracting the total number of warnings \
                   of the current build from the reference build. This may lead to wrong results if you have both fixed and \
                   new warnings in a build. If the checkbox is not set, then the number of new warnings is calculated by an \
                   asymmetric set difference of the warnings in the current and reference build. This will find all new warnings \
                   even if the number of total warnings is decreasing. However, sometimes false positives will be reported due to \
                   minor changes in a warning (refactoring of variable of method names, etc.)

threshold.100.percent=100%
threshold.0.percent=0%
description.health.limit=Configure the thresholds for the build health. If the actual number of warnings is between \
                   the provided thresholds, then the build health is interpolated.
description.health.priorities=Determines which warning priorities should be considered when evaluating the build health.
description.healthy=Report health as 100% when the number of warnings is less than this value.
description.unhealthy=Report health as 0% when the number of warnings is greater than this value.

description.status=If the total number of warnings exceeds one of these thresholds then a build is \
                   considered as unstable or failed, resp.

description.unstableTotal.all=If the total number of warnings (regardless of type) exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as unstable.
description.unstableTotal.high=If the total number of warnings with priority high exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as unstable.
description.unstableTotal.normal=If the total number of warnings with priority normal exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as unstable.
description.unstableTotal.low=If the total number of warnings  with priority low exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as unstable.

description.failedTotal.all=If the total number of warnings (regardless of type) exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as failed.
description.failedTotal.high=If the total number of warnings with priority high exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as failed.
description.failedTotal.normal=If the total number of warnings with priority normal exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as failed.
description.failedTotal.low=If the total number of warnings  with priority low exceeds this total then a build is \
                   considered as failed.

description.unstableNew.all=If the number of new warnings (regardless of type) exceeds this new then a build is \
                   considered as unstable.
