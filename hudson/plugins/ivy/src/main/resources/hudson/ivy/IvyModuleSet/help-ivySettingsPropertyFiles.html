  Property files that need to be loaded before parsing the Ivy settings
  file and Ivy module descriptors. Specified as comma-delimited list of
  relative paths from the workspace root.
  
  <p>
  This only needs to be specified if you use ${property} references in
  your Ivy settings file or in your Ivy module descriptors that normally
  get loaded by your build scripts prior to initialising Ivy.

  Example: "modules/branch.properties"
