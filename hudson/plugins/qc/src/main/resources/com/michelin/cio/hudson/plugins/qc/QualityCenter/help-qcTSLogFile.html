  <p>Name of the report that will be generated.</p>
  <p>If several test sets are run in one build step, one report will be generated
  per test set. As such, you must ensure that the name will be unique by including
  the test set name in it (through the <code>${TS_NAME}</code> variable). If it's
  not the case, then the name will be automatically post fixed with an underscore
  followed by the test set name.</p>
  <p>You can use all standard environment variables plus:
  <ul>
    <li><code>${QC_DOMAIN}</code> for the current Quality Center domain;</li>
    <li><code>${QC_PROJECT}</code> for the current Quality Center project;</li>
    <li><code>${TS_FOLDER}</code> for the current TestSet folder;</li>
    <li><code>${TS_NAME}</code> for the TestSet name.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
