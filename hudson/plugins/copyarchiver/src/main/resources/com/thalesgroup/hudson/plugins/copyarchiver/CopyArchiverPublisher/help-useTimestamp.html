    <p>
        For the shared directory, you can use build timestamp variable ${BUILD_ID}.<br/>
        By default, this variable uses the pattern 'YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss'.<br/>
        You can change this format by providing your own pattern.<br/>
        You must specify a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">java.text.SimpleDateFormat</a>
        pattern, as the value 'yyyyMMddHHmmss'.
    </p>
