Allows to deploy artifacts to a remote (maven-)repository (e.g. nexus)<br />
This post step allows to deploy as many artifacts as you wish in one job, just add as many as you wish.<br />
The POM to deploy the artifacts with, is created on the fly... 
Only if the version string contains the token 'SNAPSHOT', the snapshot repository will be used for deployment - otherwise a deployment of a released version will be assumed. 
<br />

GroupId: This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project.<br />
ArtifactId: The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by.<br />
Version: The version of the artifact to be deployed, usually this should be increasing with most of the builds - therefore typically a build parameter will be used for this.<br />
Classifier: It is some optional and arbitrary string that - if present - is appended to the artifact name just after the version number. It is often used to distinguish a second artifact build from the same sources (e.g. special build for JDK14 and 5 or sources and javadoc).<br />
Extension: This is the extension of the artifact to be resolved. Important: this is not always the same as 'packaging' in maven! (although it might be the same e.g. for 'jar')<br />
File: The file to be deployed? The name can contain subdirectories.<br />

With the syntax ${PARAMETERNAME} you can use build parameters for each of the fields - this allows for example the dynamic allocation of the version for an artifact.
