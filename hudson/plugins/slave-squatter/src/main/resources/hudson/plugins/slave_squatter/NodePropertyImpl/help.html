  Reserve a number of executors during the certain period, so that Hudson will not use those executors
  to perform builds. Useful for making Hudson aware of activities outside Hudson &mdash; such as
  when you are using people's workstations as slaves (which need to be available for interactive use
  during day time) or when the system goes through a periodical backup, which reduces the I/O capability of the system.
