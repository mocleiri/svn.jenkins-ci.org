<div>
  Runs a shell script (defaults to <tt>sh</tt>, but this is configurable) to verify that this label assignment
  is correct. If the script exits with non-zero, the label is considered invalid, and the slave will fail
  to become online.

  <p>
  The remote FS root of the node will be the working directory for the script.
  If your shell script has no header line like <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> &mdash;, then the shell configured
  system-wide will be used, but you can also use the header line to write script in another language
  (like <tt>#!/bin/perl</tt>) or control the options that shell uses.

  <p>
  By default, the shell will be invoked with the "-ex" option. So all of the commands are printed before being executed,
  and the script is considered a failure if any of the commands exits with a non-zero exit code. Again, add the
  <tt>#!/bin/...</tt> line to change this behavior.
