<div>Dynamic permission definitions allow you to automaticly grant
permissions to specifig groups at job creation time. You can define a
regular expression to get information from the jobs name. e.g. if all
your jobs follow a naming standard, like this: '<i>group.GROUP.FreeForm</i>',
you can define a pattern like '<i>group.(.*).(.*)</i>' and reuse the
regular expression groups in the group format.<br />
e.g. <br />
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Job name pattern:</td>
		<td>job.([A-Z]{3}).(.*)</td>
		<td>this is a regular expression and creates two regex groups:
		{0} and {1}</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Group format:</td>
		<td><pre>perm.{0}.Developer</pre></td>
		<td>a format to construct a group with, (pattern references (to
		the groups of the job name pattern) are optional, this allows to
		define final group names to)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Permissions:</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>check the permissions you would like the group to have for the newly created
		job</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Job name:</td>
		<td><pre>job.ABC.ProjectAJob</pre></td>
		<td>the name of the new job</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Group assigned:</td>
		<td><pre>perm.ABC.Developer</pre></td>
		<td>the final group assigend to the job - ABC from got extracted
		from the job name and used in the group format at the place of {0}.
		This group will have the selected permissions for the job.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
