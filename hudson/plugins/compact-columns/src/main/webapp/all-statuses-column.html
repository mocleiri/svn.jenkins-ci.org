<div>
This column allows you to more flexibly configure what types of statuses to show.  Options include
<br/><br/>
<b>Only show the last status</b> - Choose this if all you ever want to show is the status of the last build.
<br/>
<b>Hide additional statuses... </b> - For example, if you want to show multiple statuses, but once a build is a month old, you want to stop showing it.  Choose "0" to show all statuses.
<br/>
<b>Colorblind hints</b> - Color-coding can cause accessibility concerns.  Choose a colorblind hints option if this will be useful to you.
