  You can use as many Regular Expression Filters as you like - they will each apply in the order shown. 
  <br/>
  The Negate option allows you to much more easily choose to match all jobs which DON'T match the expression.
  <br/>
  The Exclude option allows you to exclude jobs that otherwise would have been added to the view.  This is only useful
  in combination with other Job Filters.
  <br/>
  If you choose both the Negate and Exclude options, this will exclude any jobs that do not match the expression.  
  This can only be useful when used in combination with other Job filters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A simple example would be to add two Regular Expression Filters, 
  one that includes all jobs that don't match ".*_Nightly", 
  and another filter that excludes all jobs that match ".*[Uu]til.*".
  This combination creates a view that shows all non-nightly jobs except utility jobs.
