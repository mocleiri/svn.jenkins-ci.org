  You can use as many Regular Expression Filters as you like - they will each apply in the order you put them in.
  <br/><br/>
  <u>Match Value</u>: You can choose to match on the Name, Description, Email Recipients, Maven configuration, or SCM configuration of the job.  Matching by SCM
  is extremely useful if you have hundreds of jobs that need to be "auto organized", and are already
  organized under source control.  Matching by Email is useful for organizing by "who cares about this job."
  <br/>
  <u>Match Type</u>: Choose whether this filter will add additional jobs, or remove jobs.
  <br/><br/>
  For example, combine two Regular Expression Filters in this way:<br/> 
  One with a Regular Expression of "<b>.*_Nightly</b>" for a Match Value of "<b>Job name</b>", and a Match Type of "<b>Include Matched</b>",<br/> 
  And another with a Regular Expression of "<b>.*site:deploy.*</b>" for a Match Value of "<b>Maven configuration</b>", and a Match Type of "<b>Exclude Unmatched</b>".<br/>
  This combination creates a view that shows all nightly jobs that also deploy a Maven site.
