  You can use as many Regular Expression Filters as you like - they will each apply in the order you put them in.
  <br/><br/>
  <u>Match Value</u>: You can choose to match on the Name, Description, Email Recipients, or SCM configuration of the job.  Matching by SCM
  is extremely useful if you have hundreds of jobs that need to be "auto organized", and are already
  organized under source control.  Matching by Email is useful for organizing by "who cares about this job."
  <br/>
  <u>Match Type</u>: Choose whether this filter will add additional jobs, or remove jobs.
  <br/><br/>
  A simple example would be to add two Regular Expression Filters, 
  one that includes all jobs that don't match ".*_Nightly", 
  and another filter that excludes all jobs that match ".*[Uu]til.*".
  This combination creates a view that shows all non-nightly jobs except utility jobs.
