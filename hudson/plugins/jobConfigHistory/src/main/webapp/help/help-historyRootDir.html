Enter the root directory for storing history information.
This setting must be used to preserve history when a job is deleted.
If left blank, history will be kept with the job itself and will be lost if the job is deleted.
<p>Either an absolute or relative path may be specified.  If a relative path is entered,
 it will be created below HUDSON_ROOT.  If an absolute path is entered,
the value will be used directly.</p>
