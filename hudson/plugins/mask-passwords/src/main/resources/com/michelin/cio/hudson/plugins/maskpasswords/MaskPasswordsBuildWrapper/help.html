<div>
  When enabled, allows masking passwords that may appear in the console.<br/>
  Passwords to be masked are defined as <b>Name</b>/<b>Password</b> pairs:<ul>
  <li><b>Password</b> is aimed at containing a password to be masked from the console.
  Empty and blank values are not allowed (e.g. &quot;&nbsp;&quot;, etc.). This
  field is ciphered.</li>
  <li>If <b>Name</b> is set, then a build variable will be defined accordingly.
  This allows accessing the password by using the variable rather than hard-coding
  it in a field which is not ciphered (e.g. the ones of the <b>Invoke Ant</b> or
  <b>Execute shell</b> build steps).</li>
  </ul>
</div>
